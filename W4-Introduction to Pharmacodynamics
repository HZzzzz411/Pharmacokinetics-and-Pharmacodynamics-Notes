# Lecture 4 - Introduction to Pharmacodynamics

This document provides a comprehensive and integrated overview of the core principles of pharmacodynamics, combining the foundational lecture material with the applied concepts from the tutorial.

## I. Core Definition and Scope

*   **Pharmacodynamics **(药效学): The study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on the body and their mechanisms of action. It is often referred to as "**what the drug does to the body**," in contrast to pharmacokinetics (PK), which is "what the body does to the drug."

## II. Fundamental Principles of Drug Action

Drugs do not create new actions but modify existing cellular or tissue functions. The basic types of drug action are:

1.  **Stimulation **(刺激): An increase in the functional activity of specialized cells.
    *   *Example*: Adrenaline stimulates the heart; Caffeine stimulates the CNS.
2.  **Depression **(抑制): A decrease in the functional activity of specialized cells.
    *   *Example*: Barbiturates depress the CNS; Omeprazole depresses gastric acid secretion.
3.  **Irritation **(刺激): An effect on the growth, nutrition, and morphology of living tissues that induces a significant change in cellular function.
    *   *Example*: Senna (a laxative); topical liniments for muscle pain.
4.  **Replacement **(替代): The use of natural metabolites or hormones to correct a deficiency state.
    *   *Example*: Levodopa in Parkinson's disease; Insulin in diabetes mellitus.
5.  **Chemical Action **(化学作用): Drugs act by directly combining with or neutralizing substances in the body.
    *   *Example*: Antacids (e.g., Al(OH)₃) neutralize gastric acid (HCl).
6.  **Cytotoxic Action **(细胞毒作用): Drugs exert a selective toxic effect on invading pathogens (e.g., bacteria, parasites) or cancer cells, without significantly harming host cells.
    *   *Example*: Penicillin (antibacterial); Cyclophosphamide (anticancer).

## III. Mechanisms of Drug Action

Drugs produce their effects by interacting with specific molecular targets:

1.  **Through Receptors **(受体): The most common mechanism. Drugs bind to specific protein receptors on the cell surface or inside the cell.
2.  **Through Enzymes and Pumps **(酶和泵): Drugs can inhibit or activate key enzymes or transport proteins.
    *   *Example*: Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase; Enalapril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
3.  **Through Ion Channels **(离子通道): Drugs can block or modulate the flow of ions across cell membranes.
    *   *Example*: Verapamil (Ca²⁺ channel blocker); Lidocaine (Na⁺ channel blocker); Diazepam (modulates GABA-gated Cl⁻ channels).
4.  **By Physical Action **(物理作用): The effect arises from the drug's physical properties.
    *   *Example*: Psyllium (bulk laxative); Activated charcoal (adsorption in poisoning); Magnesium sulfate (osmotic laxative).
5.  **By Chemical Interaction **(化学相互作用): The drug participates in a direct chemical reaction.
    *   *Example*: Antacids (acid-base neutralization); Potassium permanganate (oxidizing agent).
6.  **By Altering Metabolic Processes **(改变代谢过程): Drugs interfere with essential metabolic pathways in pathogens.
    *   *Example*: Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial folic acid synthesis.

## IV. Drug-Receptor Interactions: Core Concepts

The interaction between a drug and its receptor is often described by the "**lock and key**" analogy.

*   **Receptor **(受体): A protein molecule on or in a cell that a drug binds to in order to produce a response.
*   **Affinity **(亲和力): The ability of a drug to bind to its receptor. High affinity means the drug binds tightly.
*   **Efficacy **(效能) (Intrinsic Activity): The ability of a drug to activate the receptor and produce a pharmacological response once bound. It determines the **maximal effect** the drug can produce.
*   **Potency **(效力): The amount of drug (dose or concentration) required to produce a given effect. A more potent drug requires a lower dose. Potency is inversely related to **ED50/EC50** (the dose/concentration that produces 50% of the maximal effect).

### Types of Receptor-Binding Drugs

| Drug Type | Binds to Receptor? | Activates Receptor? | Has Affinity? | Has Efficacy? | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Agonist **(完全激动剂) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (High) | Morphine (at μ-opioid receptor) |
| **Partial Agonist **(部分激动剂) | Yes | Partially | Yes | Yes (Low) | Pentazocine (at μ-opioid receptor) |
| **Antagonist **(拮抗剂) | Yes | No | Yes | No | Atropine (at muscarinic receptor) |

## V. Drug Antagonism (药物拮抗作用)

Antagonism occurs when the effect of one drug is blocked or reduced by another.

1.  **Pharmacological Antagonism **(药理学拮抗作用):
    *   **Competitive Antagonism **(竞争性拮抗作用): The antagonist and agonist compete reversibly for the **same binding site** on the receptor. The blockade can be overcome by increasing the agonist concentration. Both drugs usually have **chemical resemblance** and bind via **weak bonds** (e.g., ionic, hydrogen).
        *   *Example*: Atropine (antagonist) vs. Acetylcholine (agonist) at cholinergic receptors.
    *   **Non-Competitive Antagonism **(非竞争性拮抗作用): The antagonist binds to a **different site** on the receptor (or forms an irreversible bond), preventing the agonist from producing its effect even if it binds. The blockade **cannot be overcome** by increasing agonist concentration. The drugs have **no chemical resemblance** and often bind via **strong covalent bonds**.
        *   *Example*: Phenoxybenzamine (non-competitive antagonist) vs. Noradrenaline (agonist) at α-adrenergic receptors.

2.  **Physiological Antagonism **(生理性拮抗作用): Two drugs produce **opposite physiological effects** by acting on **different receptors** and pathways.
    *   *Example*: Insulin (lowers blood glucose) vs. Glucagon (raises blood glucose).

3.  **Chemical Antagonism **(化学拮抗作用): Two drugs **directly interact** with each other in the body through a chemical reaction, neutralizing each other's activity.
    *   *Example*: Protamine sulfate (positively charged) binds to and neutralizes heparin (negatively charged). Antacids neutralize gastric acid.

## VI. Therapeutic Index (TI) (治疗指数) and Safety

*   **Therapeutic Index **(TI): A quantitative measure of a drug's safety margin. It is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity to the dose that produces the desired therapeutic effect.
    *   **Formula**: `TI = TD₅₀ / ED₅₀`
        *   **TD₅₀ **(中位中毒剂量): The dose that is toxic in 50% of the population.
        *   **ED₅₀ **(中位有效剂量): The dose that is effective in 50% of the population.
*   **Interpretation**: A **high TI** indicates a wide safety margin (e.g., Penicillin). A **low (narrow) TI** indicates a narrow safety margin, where the effective dose is very close to the toxic dose.
*   **Narrow Therapeutic Index **(NTI) (窄治疗指数): Drugs with an NTI require careful dosing and often **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring **(TDM, 治疗药物监测) to ensure safety and efficacy.
    *   *Examples of NTI drugs*: Warfarin, Lithium, Digoxin, Phenytoin, Gentamicin.
