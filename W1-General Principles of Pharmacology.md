## I. Core Definitions

*   **Pharmacology**: The **science of drugs** and their **interactions with living systems** to produce a specific effect. It include:
    *   **Pharmacodynamics** (PD 药效学): What the drug does to the body    
        Studies the **drug's effects and mechanisms** of action.
    *   **Pharmacokinetics** (PK 药代动力学): what the body does to the drug
        Studies the **drug's journey through the body** (Absorption吸收, Distribution分布, Metabolism代谢, Excretion排泄 - ADME).
    *   **Pharmacotherapeutics**  (药物治疗学):The use of drugs to treat disease (disease-centered).
    *   **Toxicology** (毒理学): The study of **adverse (harmful) effects** of drugs.
    *   **Clinical Pharmacology** (临床药理学): The study of drugs in humans, focusing on their use in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment(诊断和防治) of diseases (patient-centered).
    *   **Pharmacogenomics** (药物基因组学): The study of how an individual’s **genetic** makeup influences their response to drugs.
    *   In experiments or clinical practice, we measure 3 key parameters to link PK & PD:
        *  Therapeutic dose(治疗剂量): The administered amount of drug（给药量）  
        *  Concentration(浓度): The level of drug measured in plasma/tissues (PK outcome)
        *  Effect: The clinical/biological response observed (PD outcome)
*   **Drug**: The **active chemical** substance with **biological activity** (e.g., Paracetamol 醋氨酚).
    *  Drugs come from: Natural source (Plants, animals, minerals, microorganisms); Synthetic sources; Biotechnology
*   **Medicine (Pharmaceutical)**: The formulated product for **human use**, containing the active drug + **inactive ingredients** (excipients 赋形剂) like binders or fillers (e.g., Panadol® tablet).
*   **Dose**: The **quantity** of a drug administered at **one time**.
*   **Dosage Form**: The **physical form** in which a drug is administered (e.g., tablet, capsule, injection, syrup, cream, patch).

## II. Pharmacokinetics (PK): 

PK describes the fate of a drug within the body using the LADME framework.

*   **LADME Processes**:
    *   **Liberation (L)**: **Release** of the active drug from its dosage form.
    *   **Absorption (A)**: **Entry** of the drug into the **systemic bloodstream （blood circulation）**.
    *   **Distribution (D)**: Drug distributed throughout organs or tissues of the body
    *   **Metabolism (M)**: **Irreversible** transformation of drug in the body, primarily in the liver.
    *   **Excretion (E)**: **Removal** of the drug and its metabolites from the body (primarily via kidneys or liver).
*   **Key PK Parameters**:
    *   **Bioavailability** (F 生物利用度):
        *   **Definition**: The **rate and extent** to which the **active drug reaches** systemic circulation from its dosage form.
        *   **Measurement**: Fractional availability (F). Calculated as $$F = \frac{AUC(desired route)}{AUC(IV)}$$
        *   **Intravenous (IV 静脉) Route:** 100% bioavailability (F=1), direct entry into bloodstream.
        *   Other Routes: F ≤ 1 (≤100%) due to **incomplete absorption** or first-pass metabolism.
    *   **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**:
        *  The total **area under** the plasma drug **concentration-time curve**. Directly proportional to the total amount of drug absorbed (**extent** of absorption). AUC越大，药物被机体吸收的越完全
    *   **Rate of Absorption**: How fast the drug reaches systemic circulation. Assessed by **Cmax** (peak plasma concentration) and **Tmax** (time to reach Cmax). Relevant for extravascular routes. Cmax he Tmax 对 IV没有意义（进入体内瞬间最大）

    *   **Volume of Distribution (Vd)**:
        *   Definition: A theoretical volume relating the total amount of drug in the body to its plasma concentration. Indicates tissue distribution vs. blood confinement.
        *   Formula: `Vd (L/kg) = (Dose × F) / Plasma Concentration (C)`. For IV, F=1, so `Vd = Dose / C`.
        *   Interpretation:
            *   Low Vd (3-5 L): Confined to plasma (e.g., Heparin, Warfarin).
            *   Moderate Vd (10-20 L): Distributed in extracellular fluid (e.g., Aminoglycosides).
            *   High Vd (>40 L): Extensively distributed into tissues/fat (e.g., Chloroquine, Digoxin, Antidepressants).
    *   **Clearance (CL)**:
        *   Definition: The volume of plasma completely cleared of drug per unit time. Measures elimination efficiency.
        *   Formula (Renal Example): `CL = (Urine Concentration (U) × Urine Flow Rate (V)) / Plasma Concentration (C)`.
        *   Organs: Kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.
    *   **Half-Life (t½)**:
        *   Definition: Time required for plasma drug concentration to decrease by 50% during elimination.
        *   Clinical Significance: Determines dosing frequency and time to reach steady-state concentration.
*   **Routes of Administration**:
    *   **Enteral** (via GI Tract):
        *   *Oral (PO)*: Most common; convenient, but variable absorption/first-pass metabolism.
        *   *Sublingual*: Under tongue; rapid, bypasses liver.
        *   *Rectal (PR)*: Useful if oral not possible; partial bypass of liver.
    *   **Parenteral** (injection, bypasses GI):
        *   *Intravenous (IV)*: Direct into vein; immediate effect, 100% F.
        *   *Intramuscular (IM)*: Into muscle; good for depot/vaccines.
        *   *Subcutaneous (SC)*: Under skin; slow, sustained release (e.g., insulin).
    *   **Other Routes**:
        *   *Inhalation*: To lungs; rapid absorption (e.g., asthma meds).
        *   *Topical*: On skin/mucosa for local effect.
        *   *Transdermal*: Patch for systemic effect; slow absorption (e.g., nicotine).

## V. Pharmacodynamics (PD): "What the Drug Does to the Body"

PD studies the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs and their mechanisms of action.

*   **Drug-Receptor Interactions**:
    *   **Receptor** (受体): A specific **protein macromolecule** on or in a cell that a drug (ligand) binds to, initiating a biochemical effect.
    *   **Ligand** (配位体): A molecule (e.g., drug, hormone) that **binds to a receptor**.
    *   **Agonist**: Binds to and activates a receptor, producing a response. Has **affinity** and **intrinsic activity/efficacy** (e.g., Salbutamol → β₂ agonist → bronchodilation).
    *   **Antagonist**: Binds to a receptor but does NOT activate it, blocking agonists. Has **affinity** but **no efficacy** (e.g., Propranolol → β antagonist → ↓ heart rate).
*   **Key PD Concepts**:
    *   **Efficacy (Intrinsic Activity)**: The *maximum* biological effect a drug can produce. Answers "how well can it work?"
    *   **Potency**: The *amount* (dose/concentration) needed to produce a given effect. Answers "how much is needed?" Inversely related to EC₅₀/ED₅₀.
    *   **EC₅₀ / ED₅₀**: Concentration (EC₅₀) or dose (ED₅₀) producing 50% of the maximum effect. Standard measure for potency comparison.
    *   **Therapeutic Window**: The range of doses/concentrations between the Minimum Effective Dose/Concentration (MED/MEC) and the Minimum Toxic Dose/Concentration (MTD/MTC). Goal is to maintain levels within this window.
    *   **Therapeutic Index (TI)**:
        *   Definition: Safety margin measure. `TI = TD₅₀ / ED₅₀`.
        *   TD₅₀: Dose toxic in 50% of population.
        *   ED₅₀: Dose effective in 50% of population.
        *   Narrow TI: Dangerous drugs where effective dose is close to toxic dose (e.g., Warfarin, Digoxin, Phenytoin). Requires Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM).

## VI. Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) & Related Concepts

*   **Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)**: Any unintended, harmful reaction to a drug at normal doses.
*   **Classification of ADRs**:
    *   **Type A (Augmented)**: Predictable, dose-related, pharmacological mechanism (e.g., side effects, toxic effects).
    *   **Type B (Bizarre)**: Unpredictable, dose-independent, immune or genetic mechanism (e.g., allergic, idiosyncratic reactions).
*   **Specific Types of ADRs**:
    *   **Side Effect**: Predictable, secondary effect at therapeutic doses (e.g., drowsiness from antihistamines).
    *   **Toxic Effect**: Severe reaction from overdose/accumulation (e.g., liver failure from paracetamol overdose).
    *   **Allergic Reaction**: Unpredictable, immune-mediated (e.g., rash, anaphylaxis from penicillin).
    *   **Idiosyncratic Reaction**: Rare, unpredictable, genetically-based abnormal reaction (e.g., hemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients on sulfonamides).
*   **Tolerance**: Decreased response with repeated use, requiring higher doses (e.g., opioids, nitrates).
*   **Dependence**: State where withdrawal symptoms occur upon cessation (can be physical or psychological).
*   **Resistance**: Reduced drug effectiveness against a disease (e.g., antibiotic resistance in bacteria).

## VII. Drug Sources & Nomenclature

*   **Sources of Drugs**:
    *   **Natural**: Plants (Morphine, Digoxin), Animals (Insulin, Hormones), Minerals (Iron, Lithium), Microorganisms (Penicillin).
    *   **Synthetic**: Lab-created (majority of modern drugs, e.g., Omeprazole, Diazepam).
    *   **Biotechnology**: Genetically engineered (e.g., Human Insulin, Monoclonal Antibodies like Adalimumab).
*   **Drug Nomenclature**:
    *   **Chemical Name**: Precise molecular structure (e.g., N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide). Rarely used clinically.
    *   **Generic Name (Non-proprietary)**: Official, simplified name (e.g., Paracetamol/Acetaminophen). Standard for use.
    *   **Trade/Brand Name (Proprietary)**: Company marketing name (e.g., Tylenol®, Panadol®). One generic can have many brands.

## VIII. Core Relationship: Linking PK and PD

*   The fundamental pharmacological relationship is: **Dose → (PK) → Concentration → (PD) → Effect**.
*   PK determines the drug concentration at the site of action.
*   PD determines the biological effect produced by that concentration.
*   Integrating PK and PD is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.
