# Lecture 4 - Introduction to Pharmacodynamics

## I. Core Definition and Scope

*   **Pharmacodynamics**(药效学): The study of the **biochemical and physiological effects** of drugs on the body and their **mechanisms of action**. It is often referred to as "what the drug does to the body" in contrast to pharmacokinetics (PK), which is "what the body does to the drug."
    *   To exert their effects, drugs usually interact in a structurally specific way with a protein receptor or act on physiological processes within the body (以结构特异性的方式与蛋白质受体相互作用，或作用于体内的生理过程). 这激活了产生生理效应的次级信使系统(a secondary messenger system)
    *   药物不能产生新的作用，而**只能改变体内细胞或组织的功能**
    *   药物-受体复合物通过一个称为信号转导(signal transduction)的过程，启动细胞生化和/或分子活性的改变

*   **Signal transduction**: the process by which **a chemical or physical signal** is **transmitted through a cell** as a series of molecular events.It involves three main stages:
    *   **Reception**(接收): A signal molecule (ligand, e.g., hormone, growth factor) binds to a receptor.
    *   **Transduction**(转导): The signal is relayed through a cascade of molecular events, often involving **secondary messengers** (like cAMP, Ca²⁺) and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (磷酸化/脱磷酸作用) steps.
    *   **Response**(反应): The cell produces a specific effect, such as enzyme activation, gene expression, or changes in cell shape.


## II. Fundamental Principles of Drug Action

Drugs do not create new actions but modify existing cellular or tissue functions. The basic types of drug action are:

1.  **Stimulation**(刺激): An **increase in the functional activity** of specialized cells.
    *   Example: Caffeine stimulates the CNS, Adrenaline stimulates the heart
2.  **Depression**(抑制): A **decrease in the functional activity** of specialized cells.
    *   Example: Barbiturates depress the CNS; Omeprazole depresses gastric acid secretion.
3.  **Irritation**(刺激): An effect on the **growth, nutrition, and morphology of living tissues** that **induces** a significant **change in cellular function**.
    *   Example: Senna (a laxative); topical liniments for muscle pain.
4.  **Replacement**(替代): The use of **natural metabolites or hormones** to correct a deficiency state.
    *   Example: Insulin in diabetes mellitus; Levodopa in Parkinson's disease.
5.  **Chemical Action**(化学作用): Drugs act by **combining chemically** with substances present in the body.
    *   Example: Antacids (e.g., Al(OH)₃) neutralize gastric acid (HCl).
6.  **Cytotoxic Action**(细胞毒作用): Drugs exert a **selective toxic effect** on invading pathogens (入侵的病原体 e.g., bacteria, parasites) or cancer cells, without significantly harming host cells.
    *   Example: Penicillin (antibacterial); Cyclophosphamide (anticancer).

## III. Mechanisms of Drug Action

Drugs produce their effects by interacting with specific molecular targets (target proteins):
*   **Four primary types of target proteins**:
    1.  **Through Receptors**(受体):  Drugs bind to **specific protein receptors** on the cell surface or inside the cell. The most common mechanism.
    2.  **Through Enzymes**(酶和泵): Drugs can act by inhibition of various enzymes, 
thus altering the enzyme-mediated reactions (改变酶介导的反应).
        *   Example: Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase; Enalapril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
    3.  **Through Pumps**: 利用 ATP 或离子梯度主动把药物/内源性物质跨膜转运  
    4.  **Through Ion Channels**(离子通道): Drugs can block or modulate the flow of ions across cell membranes.
        *   Example: Verapamil (Ca²⁺ channel blocker); Lidocaine (Na⁺ channel blocker); Diazepam (modulates GABA-gated Cl⁻ channels).
*   **Three modes of action**:
    1.  **By Physical Action**(物理作用): The effect arises from the drug's physical properties.
       *   Example: Psyllium (bulk laxative); Activated charcoal (adsorption in poisoning); Magnesium sulfate (osmotic laxative 渗透性泻药).
    2.  **By Chemical Interaction**(化学相互作用): The drug participates in a direct chemical reaction.
       *   Example: Antacids (acid-base neutralization); Potassium permanganate (oxidizing agent).
    3.  **By Altering Metabolic Processes**(改变代谢过程): Drugs like antimicrobials alter the metabolic pathway in the microorganismsresulting in destruction of the microorganism (抗菌剂这样的药物会改变微生物的代谢途径，导致微生物的破坏). Interfere with essential metabolic pathways in pathogens.
       *   Example: Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial folic acid synthesis.

## IV. Drug-Receptor Interactions Concepts

*   **Receptor**(受体): A **protein molecule** on or in a cell that a drug binds to in order to produce a response (e.g., cholinergic receptors).
    *  **Type**: Ion channels receptor; G-protein coupled receptors; Enzymatic receptors; Transcription factors
    *  **Binding forces**: Ionic bond; Vander wal forces; Hydrogen bond; Covalent bond
*   **Potency**(效力): The amount of drug (dose or concentration) required to produce a given effect (specified level of response). A more potent drug requires a lower dose. Potency is inversely related to **ED50/EC50** (the dose/concentration that produces 50% of the maximal effect).
*   **Affinity**(亲和力): The **ability of a drug to bind** to its receptor. High affinity means the drug binds tightly.
*   **Efficacy**(效能) (Intrinsic Activity): The ability of a drug to activate the receptor and **produce a pharmacological response** once bound. It determines the **maximal effect (Cmax)** the drug can produce.


### Types of Receptor-Binding Drugs

| Drug Type | Binds to Receptor? | Activates Receptor? | Has Affinity? | Has Efficacy? | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Agonist**(完全激动剂) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (High) | Morphine (at μ-opioid receptor) |
| **Partial Agonist**(部分激动剂) | Yes | Partially | Yes | Yes (Low) | Pentazocine (at μ-opioid receptor) |
| **Antagonist**(拮抗剂) | Yes | No | Yes | No | Atropine (at muscarinic receptor) |

## V. Drug Antagonism (药物拮抗作用)

Antagonism occurs when the effect of one drug is blocked or reduced by another.

1.  **Pharmacological Antagonism**(药理学拮抗作用):
    *   **Competitive Antagonism**(竞争性拮抗作用): The antagonist and agonist compete **reversibly** for the **same binding site** on the receptor. The blockade can be **overcome by increasing the agonist concentration**. Both drugs usually have **chemical resemblance** and bind via **weak bonds** (e.g., ionic, hydrogen). 作用时间短
        *   *Example*: Atropine (antagonist) vs. Acetylcholine (agonist) at cholinergic receptors.
    *   **Non-Competitive Antagonism**(非竞争性拮抗作用): The antagonist binds to a **different site** on the receptor (or forms an **irreversible** bond), preventing the agonist from producing its effect even if it binds. The blockade **cannot be overcome** by increasing agonist concentration. The drugs have **no chemical resemblance** and often bind via **stable bond**(strong covalent bonds).
        *   *Example*: Bicuculine (non-competitive antagonist) vs. Diazepam (agonist) at GABA receptors.
        *   Fundamental difference between competitive and non-competitive antagonistsis: **competitive** agonistsreduce **agonist potency** and **non-competitive** antagonistsreduce **agonist efficacy**.

2.  **Physiological Antagonism**(生理性拮抗作用): Two drugs produce **opposite physiological effects** by acting on **different receptors** and pathways.
    *   *Example*: Insulin (lowers blood glucose) vs. Glucagon (raises blood glucose).

3.  **Chemical Antagonism**(化学拮抗作用): Two drugs **directly interact** with each other in the body through a chemical reaction, neutralizing each other's activity.
    *   *Example*: Protamine (positively charged) binds to and neutralizes heparin (negatively charged). Antacids neutralize gastric acid.
  
| Type of Antagonism | Mechanism | Binding Site | Reversibility by Increasing Agonist | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Competitive** |  Agonist and antagonist compete reversibly for the **same binding site** on the receptor. | Same as agonist | **Yes** | Atropine (antagonist) vs. Acetylcholine (agonist) at muscarinic receptors |
| **Non-Competitive** | Antagonist binds to a **different site**, forms an **irreversible bond**, preventing receptor activation. | different site on the receptor| **No** |  Bicuculine (non-competitive antagonist) vs. Diazepam (agonist) at GABA receptors |
| **Physiological** | Two drugs act on **different receptors/pathways** to produce **opposing physiological effects**. | N/A (different receptors) | N/A | Insulin (lowers blood glucose) vs. Glucagon (raises blood glucose) |
| **Chemical** | Two drugs **directly interact** via a **chemical reaction** to neutralize each other's activity. | N/A (no receptor involved) | N/A | Protamine (antidote) neutralizes Heparin (anticoagulant) |

## VI. Therapeutic Index (TI) (治疗指数) and Safety

*   **Therapeutic Index**(TI): A quantitative measure of a **drug's safety margin**. It is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity to the dose that produces the desired therapeutic effect.
    *   **Formula**: $TI = \frac{TD₅₀}{ED₅₀}$ 
        *   **TD₅₀**(中位中毒剂量): The dose that is toxic in 50% of the population.
        *   **ED₅₀**(中位有效剂量): The dose that is effective in 50% of the population.
*   **Interpretation**: A **high TI** indicates a wide safety margin (e.g., Penicillin). A **low (narrow) TI** indicates a narrow safety margin, where the effective dose is very close to the toxic dose.
*   **Narrow Therapeutic Index**(NTI) (窄治疗指数): Drugs with an NTI require careful dosing and often Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM, 治疗药物监测) to ensure safety and efficacy.
    *   *Examples of NTI drugs*: Warfarin, Lithium, Digoxin, Phenytoin, Gentamicin.
